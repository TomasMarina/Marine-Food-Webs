# Marine-Food-Webs
This is a repository with the aim of storing complex and highly-resolved (taxonomically speaking) marine food webs.

Most of the food webs were compiled and analysed for the folowing research we publish in PlosOne in 2018:
"Architecture of marine food webs: To be or not be a â€˜small-world", https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198217
